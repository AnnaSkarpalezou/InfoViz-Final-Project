# Analyzing Airbnb Rentals Dataset

Welcome to the Airbnb Dataset Exploratory Analysis! We hope to understand the Airbnb rental environment in China through an exploratory review of the Airbnb datasets in this research. We attempt to answer the following questions using static and dynamic visualizations:

* How do listing price rates differ from neighborhood to neighbourhood?
* How does the popularity of listings on Airbnb by neighbourhood change over the year?
* What are the various categories of properties in China? Can they differ depending on where you live?
* Which neighbourhoods offer the highest number of available airbnb listings?
* Which neighborhoods in New York get high marks from visitors?
* How does Shanghai Compare to Beijing?
