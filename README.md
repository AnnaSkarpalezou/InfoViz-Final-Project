<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Welcome to the Airbnb Dataset Exploratory Analysis! We hope to understand the Airbnb rental environment in China through an exploratory review of the Airbnb datasets in this research. We attempt to answer the following questions using static and dynamic visualizations:

* How do listing price rates differ from neighborhood to neighbourhood?
* How does the popularity of listings on Airbnb by neighbourhood change over the year?
* What are the various categories of properties in China? Can they differ depending on where you live?
* Which neighbourhoods offer the highest number of available airbnb listings?
* How does Shanghai Compare to Beijing?

Airbnb is a digital platform through which users can organize and deliver hospitality and tourism experiences. This hospitality service can be accessed via their website or smartphone applications. The aim of this visualisation project was to analyze and estimate the most common rental neighbourhoods in Shanghai, as well as how much it would on average cost for someone were considering a trip here. We are also exploring the popularity of each neighbourhood throughout the year, as well as offering some aggregate statistics by neighbourhood.
The visualizations we created are intended to assist users in exploring common neighbourhoods based on their preferences if they wanted to book a trip and ride around or transit around Shanghai or Beijing. Our data and visualizations are mainly aimed at travelers looking for low-cost accommodations during the best time in the year. People looking for a cheap place to stay for a single night or a place to host a small gathering/event are among our secondary community.
The cover page and visualization without selection look as follows:

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

The data set used in this project can be accessed and imported directly into each model, from google drive. It is available to the entirety of the NYU network, however not publicly available as the information is of sensitive. The data preprocessing for each model is done in its respective jupyter notebook. The suggested order to view the jupyter notebooks begins with moving_average+linear_regression, then PCA+LSTM and lastly Optimization. 

### Prerequisites

- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (An open source deep learning platform) 


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Each of the models in the models folder, can be used to predict futute stock prices. The dataset expected is a 2d dataframe, with dates as rows and different metrics for stocks in columns. The Portfolio Optimizer file, when fed predicted prices will output the weights for a portfolio of maximised returns over risk (sharpe ratio), sparcified through the l1 Lasso loss function.
